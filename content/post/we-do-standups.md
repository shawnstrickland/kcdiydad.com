In this house, we do standups. But why?

##First, Homeschool
The schooling of our first child has been an interesting journey.
It went from traditional public school, to an alternative creativity- and group-based public school, to private school, and eventually landing on homeschool.
This was the only way we could ensure that our daughter was being challenged and educated at a rate appropriate for her.
It impressed us so much that we decided to put the other kids into it as well. This isn't that much of an ask, they already were being sent home and required to "learn remotely" 
at elementary ages because of Covid.
